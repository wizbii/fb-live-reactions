### Prerequisites

In order to fetch data from Facebook, you will need to have a Facebook app.
Have a look at this article to learn more about how you can create one: [How to get a Facebook Access Token](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/access-token/).

### How can I get my access token?

If you don't have an access token, a simpler solution is to provide your app id and secret.
From the "download" form, below the "access token" field, simply click on "I don't have one".
Refer to the next question to learn more about accessing your app's id and secret.

### How can I access my app id and secret?

Your app's id and secret are available in the developers dashboard:

1. Go to [facebook for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. Access your app from the "my app" dropdown
