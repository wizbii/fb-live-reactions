# fb-live-reactions

Facebook has now included a rule against using reactions as a voting mechanism: [Reactions Guidelines](https://en.facebookbrand.com/assets/reactions).
Not following the guidelines can lead to your Facebook page being deleted.

*This project used to be a Facebook live reactions template inspired by [Capture and stream in real-time Facebook Live reactions](https://socialwall.me/en/capture-stream-in-real-time-facebook-live-reactions/#).*
